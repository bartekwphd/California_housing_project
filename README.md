## California_housing_project
This Data Science project focused on predicting house prices in specific regions of California in the year 1990 using machine learning techniques.

### Introduction
This project is the result of my journey as a beginner Data Scientist, eager to learn and explore the world of machine learning. The main goal here is to delve into the application of machine learning models, particularly through the lens of linear regression, to address a real-world problem.

### Dataset
The dataset I've used for this project is called **fetch_california_housing**, and it provides **real-world data** directly from the **scikit-learn** library. This dataset contains various features related to housing attributes in California during 1990, including factors like location, size, population density, and median income.

### Learning Focus
As someone who is relatively new to the field of Data Science and machine learning, my primary aim was to learn and practice the essential concepts of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation. By working on this project, I hope to gain practical insights into the entire lifecycle of a machine learning project.
